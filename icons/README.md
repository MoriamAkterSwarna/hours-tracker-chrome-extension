# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
1. Online tools like [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/) or [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
2. Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
3. Icon libraries like [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have icons yet, the extension will still work but Chrome may show default icons. You can:

1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Use any PNG image and resize it to the required dimensions
3. The extension functionality will work regardless of icons

## Icon Design Suggestions

- Use a clock, timer, or practice-related symbol
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use consistent colors across all sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
